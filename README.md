### I was given an assignment through `Internshala` to recreate a webpage using only a `screenshot`. It was an `NFT` themed website.

## Procedure:-
### While designing this website, it was essential to recreate the `color palette`, exact `font` used, `layouts`, `sizes` and other properties. In addition to this, I made the buttons interactive and the whole website is `responsive` i:e good to view on any device.

## Notes:-
### The website uses `white`, `black` and a `dark grey` with a tint of blue color combination. The font used is `Space Grotesk` in varying weights. The NFT cards are `dynamically` rendered, fetching info from a `JSON` file which contains all the info. If you `add more` objects, it will `render` them accordingly. Equal amount of time was given to create this website good to view on mobile devices as well. There was use of `@media` query as well as `calc()` function to adjust sizes and layouts accordingly. `Minimum` sizes have been given to the elements.

### `ReactJS`, vanilla `CSS`, `Vitejs` and `pnpm` were used for creating this website. It is deployed on `Netlify`.
